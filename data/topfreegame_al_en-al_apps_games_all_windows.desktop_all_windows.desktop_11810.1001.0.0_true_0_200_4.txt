As you may know, most Solitaire games are not winnable, despite playing your best. We decided to fix that and provide you with the best game experience. We included in this game only winnable deals for both types of games: games in which you draw one card, and games in which you draw 3 cards. Thus you can be sure that you will win if you play perfectly.\r\nDownload and play now! \r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ 100.000+ Solvable deals \r\n✓ Draw 1 or Draw 3 cards option\r\n✓ Advanced Hint option\r\n✓ Unlimited Undo\r\n✓ Easy to use \r\n✓ High quality graphics\r\n✓ Daily/monthly/all time highscores\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ HOW TO PLAY ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ In this game you have to build up 4 stacks of cards of the same suit in each of the 4 foundation piles from the top of the screen. Each of the foundation piles must start with an ace and end with a king.\r\n✓ The cards from the 7 columns can be placed in descending order by alternating between red (hearts and diamonds) and black (spades and clubs). For example, you can place a 5 of hearts on a 6 of spades. \r\n✓ You are allowed to move runs of cards between columns. A run is a set of cards with numbers in a descending order and alternating colors.\r\n✓ If you ever get empty columns you can place a king or any run starting with a king.\r\n✓ When you run out of useful moves you can continue by tapping on the deck at the top left of the screen. You will draw 1 card or 3 cards depending on the type of the game. If there are no more cards in the deck tap on its outline to draw more cards from the beginning.\r\n✓ You should try to expose more and more cards as quickly as possible. Important cards might be buried under other cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

After all, they have so many beneficial vitamins. And each of them is unlike the other. Red, blue, and green, large and small, hard and soft. Some are sweet, others sour, and still more are salty. You might think that each fruit has its own personality. Merry strawberries, clumsy cabbages, and carefree oranges. I wonder what they would be like if they could live among us? We decided to indulge our imaginations and presented each fruit in its own characteristic way. The result turned out to be very interesting and fun!\r\n\r\nConnect points is a learning puzzle for small children. It helps develop thinking, improve memory and attention. The application has three game modes: by numbers, letters and coloring. Game modes with letters and numbers will be useful for kindergarten and pre-K kids. \r\nConnecting by numbers will help to easily memorize the order of numbers and learn to count. To do this, you need to consecutively connect circles with numbers starting from 1. As you connect circles in the right order, the silhouette of a hidden picture will become more and more visible. If three points are chosen incorrectly, a tip will pop up. Once all the points are fully connected, the picture will become fully visible and you’ll be able to color it.\r\nThose studying the alphabet can choose to connect points by letters. It is important that children know letters as early as possible, since it is essential for learning to read and write. But knowing the order of letters in the alphabet is also very important! This can be achieved by connecting circles with letters in the right sequence.\r\nThe coloring mode will be especially appreciated by young artists. In this mode, you can proceed to coloring pictures without connecting points. To make the process even more exciting, you can change any predefined color. To do this, press and hold the paint bucket and choose the necessary color from the palette.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode.

Compete against players from around the world in a high speed online race.\r\n\r\nFUN DRIVING \r\nTraffic Race 3D 2 is a mixture of arcade racing and casual driving on open tracks. No more re-spawns when you hit the race track border. Go crazy and find the fastest route on each track. \r\n\r\nENDLESS RUNNER GAME MODE \r\nWe’ve invented a combination of endless running mode with a checkpoint system. You will not die because you crash, your car will take damage but just keep on going for as far as you can! \r\n\r\nGLOBAL HIGH SCORE\r\nAre you the best driver in the world? Now you can prove it! Show the world that you are the next Schumacher or Hamilton. Can you make it to 1st place in the global rank? We reset ranks every week on Mondays to keep the competition alive.  \r\n\r\nARCADE RACING PHYSICS\r\nWe’ve taken inspiration from all extreme motor sports: Nascar, F1, Le mans, Rally and then we’ve stripped it down to a casual driving experience. This lets you drift around corners at 240 km/h with your car while still having fun and do crash as often as you wish. \r\n\r\nSUITABLE FOR ALL AGES (PEGI 3)\r\nEveryone can enjoy Traffic Race 3D 2. You will actually probably become a better real driver regardless if you are an adult, teenager or child. \r\n\r\nINTUITIVE CONTROLS\r\nThe goal of this game is to make it easy and fast to run on any device (Mobile, PC, Tablet). \r\n\r\nCAMERA OF YOUR CHOICE\r\nWe’ve added the opportunity for you to switch camera mode between Chase, Helicopter or cockpit view so you really feel that you are driving a real car.  \r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE – AI DRIVERS\r\nOur game includes AI drivers but our drivers are not perfect. They make mistakes and will not always stay on the track, probably just like you :o)\r\n\r\n100% FREE – WE PROMISE\r\nYou can unlock all cars and courses for free. You do not need to buy any smurf coins to play this game. Each time you race you gain coins to unlock cars. Courses can only be unlocked by achieving the best times on each track.  We do offer one IAP and we call it “All Inclusive”, it gives you all cars and eliminates all ads. \r\n\r\nFEEDBACK\r\nWe are listening to feedback from our users.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans. \r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. \r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\n•Available in the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://driftmania2.com  \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com   \r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudiolay against a friend using the new online multiplayer mode.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans. \r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. \r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\n•Available in the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://driftmania2.com  \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com   \r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCLB","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Zen Table Tennis Free","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22052.9007199266251365.9677e8eb-2947-4bd7-9a5e-3b46360e498f.7d17a0e9-eb44-437b-9216-c0484ea436fe","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#005995","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["28861RESETgame.ZenTableTennisFree_35b8x47qztent"],"ContentIds":["ee0d64d1-6b12-167d-844b-6cf4771f4574"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Zen Table Tennis: the world's most intense sport.\r\n\r\nIt is a long way from the pick-up ping pong matches in the back alleys of Lhasa to the ethereal mountaintop temple of the Ten Thousand Paddles.

Prove it!\r\n\r\nThe faster you go, the more amazing your tricks will be.\r\n\r\nWhy is Stickman hook so perfect?\r\n- Because you can swing like a spider\r\n- Because your stickman dances at the end of each game (We challenge you to reproduce his dance)\r\n- Because there is a grappling hook (and grapples are cool, right?)\r\n\r\nYou LOVE Stickman Hook?","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFHWHP","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Mahjong Deluxe Free","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62066.9007199266246684.043d964b-d685-443c-af96-23360119db27.e021208a-90a1-4be3-b413-eaeb4f16684c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43616.9007199266246684.043d964b-d685-443c-af96-23360119db27.fd3c2aa8-5d76-4c72-9269-64dc1e5ec476","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12011.9007199266246684.043d964b-d685-443c-af96-23360119db27.03ad2769-5891-4fbe-8d86-628df375ffea","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30448.9007199266246684.043d964b-d685-443c-af96-23360119db27.4ddf62a6-6162-4f3e-8239-a42750111a61","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35861.9007199266246684.043d964b-d685-443c-af96-23360119db27.e21a8eef-376a-4440-ab0c-1ca6edb06076","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39378.9007199266246684.043d964b-d685-443c-af96-23360119db27.137181a8-9a7e-44ad-8dca-71d9e8f0f12c","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62726.9007199266246684.043d964b-d685-443c-af96-23360119db27.fcb9613f-8fb7-41f1-8d46-2b35784d9894","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47982.9007199266246684.043d964b-d685-443c-af96-23360119db27.1f77a1af-0dda-4880-9db3-555b115707cd","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56575.9007199266246684.043d964b-d685-443c-af96-23360119db27.e28ec158-55ff-46af-a234-b73202fabc36","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["664D3057.MahjongDeluxeFree_wwtpmf9bcrwqj"],"ContentIds":["942c0d7e-8f27-7940-8089-3541705dfcd6","d961e999-666b-4332-002f-9d04847aae28","48070fce-72b4-161b-2d43-62035e0c8331"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Mahjong Deluxe is a solitaire game based on the classic Chinese game where you are challenged to eliminate all the tiles from the board.

In this derby simulator limiting car damage is key to becoming victorious and how you smash into other cars makes a big difference.

Be sure to upgrade your cars wisely as the various type of events require different cars. Use armor upgrades to strengthen your endurance; or engine upgrades to boost your speed. To get your upgrades you earn money during races. The better you perform the more you earn. Before a race you can also buy power-ups to boost your performance during a race. The nitro boost will allow you to accelerate super-fast and smash your opponents even harder; or choose one of the other power-ups such an armor booster to strengthen your car during the race. \r\n\r\nIf you like demolition games this game is made for you!\r\n3, 2, 1 start your download and join the ultimate demolition derby game experience now!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P8F5M0Z3PH5","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Tactical Monsters Rumble Arena","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11177.14093790597907572.40444bf5-4397-4c3d-8642-537669030a95.bfe3bb4e-cbd6-4444-9b27-fae0684393dd","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36914.14093790597907572.40444bf5-4397-4c3d-8642-537669030a95.e210419f-df42-44ae-9c75-3c2532de326d","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22287.14093790597907572.8382e451-bdfa-406e-800e-881a8504bff8.68e1d549-2af3-4cd8-a4c7-7320598b7a4c","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8095.14093790597907572.c16f79b7-8564-4cf1-87be-f2f466fea791.8dfdcd66-005a-4ad3-9383-84a474cda61c","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22436.14093790597907572.0a1f600b-d6c3-4d5b-a59c-77e7a06438d0.2daaf27f-b1e2-41ca-ac83-73c4b356417d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33506.14093790597907572.f09802f0-822a-42a6-a500-c9ff3c110061.dee82384-457f-476a-aadc-a18a2ebb7470","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["CamexGames.TacticalMonstersRumbleArena_cb4jq8xmyjah0"],"ContentIds":["d035ea6f-8cf5-cea7-fc58-ca788e6613f3","31f6fd72-acdc-2755-2624-df52773e88ac"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"[IGN Review]: “Tactical Monsters is a hex grid, turn based strategy game where ghost, ghouls and everything in between come to blows in fast-paced action.” \r\n\r\n[Gameranx Review]: “IT’S JUST DAMN GOOD.
